Purpose.  A data scientist who uses Python needs to be fluent with NumPy.  The purpose of this assignment is to help you build your NumPy skills.

Instructions.  Download numpy-basics.py from below.  Open the file in Spyder or your favorite IDE.  Each line that begins with #@ is a problem, sometimes followed by one or more regular comment lines.  After each problem, enter your Python code.  Your code can consist of 1 or more lines.  The last line of each problem description says whether you should provide an expression or an assignment. 

If the problem asks for an expression, the last line of your code for that problem should be an expression that gives the answer. 

If the problem asks for an assignment to a variable, the last line of your code for that problem should be that assignment.

The problem description also lists any variables that your code can assume to be defined.  Any other variables in your code must be defined in your code.

Please follow the instructions carefully, as your code is graded automatically.

Submission.  Submit your edited numpy-basics.py on Canvas.

Grading.  Each problem is worth four points.
