Week 2 Homework
The purpose of this assignment is to help you develop skills with Pandas by applying them to data on cars from 1978.  This assignment is a great preparation for next week's lectures and homework assignment.

Instructions.  Download cars.py from below.  Open the file in Spyder or your favorite IDE.  Each line that begins with #@ is a problem, sometimes followed by one or more regular comment lines.  After each problem, enter your Python code.  Your code can consist of 1 or more lines.  The last line of each problem description says whether you should provide an expression or an assignment.  If the problem asks for an expression, the last line of your code for that problem should be an expression that gives the answer.  If the problem asks for an assignment to a variable, the last line of your code for that problem should be that assignment.

The problem description also lists any variables that your code can assume to be defined.  Any other variables in your code must be defined in your code.

New: The file output.txt Download : The file output.txt will help you check your code.  This file contains the output from my solutions to the problems in the assignment.

Please follow the instructions carefully, as your code is graded automatically.

Submission.  Submit your edited cars.py on Canvas.

Grading.  Each problem is worth 100/16 = 6.25 points.

You can use the homework channel of our Slack team to ask for clarification about homework problems, but please donâ€™t post answers or hints.

Fun: Each of the questions in this homework can be solved in a single line. Feel free to challenge yourself.
